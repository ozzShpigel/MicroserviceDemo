## The Goals of This Project

- :sparkle: Using `Domain Driven Design (DDD)` to implement all business processes in microservices.
- :sparkle: Using `Rabbitmq` for `Event Driven Architecture` between our microservices.
- :sparkle: Using `CQRS` implementation with `MediatR` library.
- :sparkle: Using `Fluent Validation` and a `Validation Pipeline Behaviour` on top of `MediatR`.
- :sparkle: Using `Docker-Compose` for our deployment mechanism.
- :sparkle: Using `GitHub Actions` for automation processes.
- :sparkle: Using `Terraform` for buiding the environment.

## Plan

> üåÄThis project is a work in progress, new features will be added over time.üåÄ

I will try to register future goals and additions in the [Issues](https://github.com/ozzshpigel-organization/MicroserviceDemo/issues) section of this repository.

## :heart: Technologies - Libraries

- ‚úîÔ∏è **[`.NET 6`](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)** - .NET Framework and .NET Core, including ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core
with ASP.NET Web API, and ASP.NET Core
- ‚úîÔ∏è **[`EF Core`](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore)** - Modern object-database mapper for .NET. It supports LINQ queries, change tracking, updates, and schema migrations
- ‚úîÔ∏è **[`MediatR`](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)** - Simple, unambitious mediator implementation in .NET.
- ‚úîÔ∏è **[`FluentValidation`](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation)** - Popular .NET validation library for building strongly-typed validation rules
- ‚úîÔ∏è **[`Swagger & Swagger UI`](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore)** - Swagger tools for documenting API's built on ASP.NET Core

## The Domain And Bounded Context - Service Boundary

- `Customer Service`: The Customer Service is a bounded context `CRUD` service to handle customer related operations.

- `Order Service`: The Order Service is a bounded context `CRUD` service to handle order related operations.
